**Post on Twitter:**
```
Built custom Claude Desktop tools that connect to:
- PostgreSQL/MySQL databases

- Any website for scraping

Your team asks in natural language, Claude handles the rest.

Looking for 3 pilot customers. Free implementation.

DM if interested 👇
```

**Record a 2-min Loom video:**

## WHEN YOU GET STUCK

### "No one's responding to emails"

**Fix:**
- Add more personalization (mention specific detail about their company)
- Try different subject lines
- Send LinkedIn messages instead
- Offer free pilot (removes risk)

### "Can't close deals"

**Fix:**
- Lower price for first 3 clients
- Offer payment plans
- Create urgency ("3 pilot spots available")
- Ask: "What would make this a no-brainer?"

### "Don't know how to build something"

**Fix:**
- Use FusionAL AI agent to generate it
- Search GitHub for similar MCP servers
- Ask in MCP community Slack
- Start simple, add features later

### "Feeling overwhelmed"

**Fix:**
- Focus on ONE outreach channel (email)
- Just send 2 emails per day
- Book 1 call per week
- Build momentum slowly

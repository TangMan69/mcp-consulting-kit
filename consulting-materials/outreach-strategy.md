## COLD EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Problem-First (Best Converter)

```
Subject: Eliminate context switching for [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is using Claude for [specific use case - check their job posts/tweets].

Quick question: How much time does your team waste switching between Slack, GitHub, [their CRM], and Claude?

I build custom Claude Desktop tools that connect all your systems. Your team runs database queries, creates GitHub issues, sends Slack messages—all through natural language. Zero context switching.

Recent client (SaaS, ~100 employees): 75% faster support response, saved $8k/month.

Worth a 15-min call this week?

[Your Name]
[Phone]
```

**When to use:** First outreach to warm leads

### Template 2: Showcase-First

```
Subject: Built this for you: [Tool Name] for Claude Desktop

[Name],

I built a Claude Desktop integration that I think [Company Name] would find useful:

[Brief description - e.g., "Queries your PostgreSQL database in natural language. Ask 'top 10 customers by revenue' and get instant results."]

I'm offering free pilot implementations to 3 companies this month. Interested in being one of them?

Takes 1-2 weeks, zero risk. If it doesn't save your team at least 10 hours/week, you pay nothing.

Available for a call Thursday or Friday?

Best,
[Name]

P.S. - Examples of what I've built: [link to showcase servers]
```

**When to use:** When you have a specific tool idea for them

### Template 3: Referral/Network

```
Subject: [Mutual Contact] suggested I reach out

Hi [Name],

[Mutual Contact] mentioned you're exploring AI automation at [Company].

I specialize in building custom Claude Desktop tools that integrate with your existing stack. Think: natural language queries for databases, automated Slack notifications, GitHub issue management—all without leaving Claude.

[Mutual Contact] saw what I built for [Client Name] and thought it'd be perfect for your [team/use case].

15 minutes to explore if this makes sense for [Company Name]?

## LINKEDIN MESSAGE TEMPLATES

### Connection Request Message:

```
Hi [Name], I build custom AI automation tools for [their industry]. Saw your post about Claude - would love to connect and share what's possible with MCP integrations.
```

### Follow-up Message:

```
Hey [Name], thanks for connecting!

I noticed [Company] is using Claude. Are you running into any friction with having to manually pull data from databases, APIs, or internal tools?

I'm building Claude Desktop integrations that eliminate that. Recent project: engineering team now deploys, monitors, and troubleshoots through natural language. Saved them ~20 hrs/week.

Open to exploring something similar for [Company]?

## DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPT

### Opening (2 min):
"Thanks for taking time. I build custom AI automation—specifically MCP servers that connect Claude Desktop to your business systems.

Before I explain more, help me understand: What tools does your team use daily? And how much time do they spend switching between them?"

**[LISTEN - Take notes]**

### Qualification Questions (5 min):
1. "How many people on your team?"
2. "Using Claude Team or Enterprise?"
3. "What's your current automation stack?" (Zapier, Make, custom scripts)
4. "If you could ask Claude to do ONE thing in your stack, what would it be?"
5. "What's your budget for automation/AI tools per quarter?"

### Demo (3 min):
"Let me show you what this looks like..."

**[Screen share one of your showcase servers]**

"This is a database integration. I can say 'show me top customers by revenue' and it queries PostgreSQL directly. No SQL, no switching tools."

### Closing (5 min):
**If interested:**
"Here's what next looks like:
- Week 1: I build 1-2 tools based on your top pain points
- Week 2: Your team tests, I refine
- Week 3: Production deployment + training
- Investment: $2,500-$7,500 depending on complexity

Sound good? Let's schedule a kickoff call."

**If hesitant:**
"Would a free proof-of-concept help? I'll build one tool for free, you test it. If your team loves it, we continue. If not, no charge. Fair?"

## PRICING STRATEGY

### Anchor High:
"Normally this would be $10k-15k, but since you're an early client, I can do it for $7,500."

### Value-Based Pricing Formula:
**Client's cost = (Hours saved per week × Team size × Avg hourly rate × 52 weeks) / 10**

Example:
- Save 10 hrs/week
- 5 person team
- $75/hr avg rate
- = $195k/year saved
- Your price: $19.5k

(But you'll actually charge $7.5k-15k as "pilot pricing")

### Payment Terms:
- 50% upfront to start
- 50% on delivery
- Or 3 monthly payments for retainers

## OBJECTION HANDLING

**"We already use Zapier/Make"**
→ "Those are great for simple automations. This is different—it's conversational AI that understands context. Your team asks in natural language, no workflows to build."

**"Can't we just use Claude API directly?"**
→ "Absolutely, if you have engineering resources. I'm offering turnkey solutions—you focus on your business, I handle the technical complexity."

**"This is too expensive"**
→ "I get it. Let me ask: what's the cost of your team spending 10+ hours/week on manual tasks? This pays for itself in month 1."

**"We need to see it working first"**
→ "Perfect. Let's do a free proof-of-concept. I'll build one tool, you test it. If it doesn't deliver value, you owe me nothing."

**"We're not ready yet"**
→ "No problem. Can I send you a case study from a similar company? And let's reconnect in [30/60/90] days."

## COLD EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Problem-First (Best Converter)

```
Subject: Eliminate context switching for [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is using Claude for [specific use case - check their job posts/tweets].

Quick question: How much time does your team waste switching between Slack, GitHub, [their CRM], and Claude?

I run a done-for-you Claude Desktop automation service. I install and customize integrations so your team can run database queries, create GitHub issues, and send Slack messages through natural language.

Recent client (SaaS, ~100 employees): 75% faster support response, saved $8k/month.

Typical engagement is a 2-week install + ongoing monthly optimization/support.

Worth a 15-min call this week?

[Your Name]
[Phone]
```

**When to use:** First outreach to warm leads

### Template 2: Showcase-First

```
Subject: Built this for you: [Tool Name] for Claude Desktop

[Name],

I mapped a Claude Desktop workflow your team could use immediately:

[Brief description - e.g., "Queries your PostgreSQL database in natural language. Ask 'top 10 customers by revenue' and get instant results."]

I reserve 2 implementation slots per month so quality stays high. Interested in seeing if [Company Name] is a fit?

Initial rollout takes 1-2 weeks, then we move into monthly support/optimization if you want ongoing improvements.

Available for a call Thursday or Friday?

Best,
[Name]

P.S. - Examples of what I've built: [link to showcase servers]
```

**When to use:** When you have a specific tool idea for them

### Template 3: Referral/Network

```
Subject: [Mutual Contact] suggested I reach out

Hi [Name],

[Mutual Contact] mentioned you're exploring AI automation at [Company].

I specialize in implementing Claude Desktop automations for teams already using tools like Slack, GitHub, Stripe, and internal databases.

[Mutual Contact] saw what I built for [Client Name] and thought it'd be perfect for your [team/use case].

15 minutes to explore if this makes sense for [Company Name]?

[Your Name]
```

**When to use:** Warm introductions (best conversion rate)

## LINKEDIN MESSAGE TEMPLATES

### Connection Request Message:

```
Hi [Name], I build custom AI automation tools for [their industry]. Saw your post about Claude - would love to connect and share what's possible with MCP integrations.
```

### Follow-up Message:

```
Hey [Name], thanks for connecting!

I noticed [Company] is using Claude. Are you running into any friction with having to manually pull data from databases, APIs, or internal tools?

I'm building Claude Desktop integrations that eliminate that. Recent project: engineering team now deploys, monitors, and troubleshoots through natural language. Saved them ~20 hrs/week.

Open to exploring something similar for [Company]?
```

## DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPT

### Opening (2 min):
"Thanks for taking time. I run a done-for-you AI automation implementation service using MCP servers connected to your business systems.

Before I explain more, help me understand: What tools does your team use daily? And how much time do they spend switching between them?"

**[LISTEN - Take notes]**

### Qualification Questions (5 min):
1. "How many people on your team?"
2. "Using Claude Team or Enterprise?"
3. "What's your current automation stack?" (Zapier, Make, custom scripts)
4. "If you could ask Claude to do ONE thing in your stack, what would it be?"
5. "What's your budget for automation/AI tools per quarter?"

### Demo (3 min):
"Let me show you what this looks like..."

**[Screen share one of your showcase servers]**

"This is a database integration. I can say 'show me top customers by revenue' and it queries PostgreSQL directly. No SQL, no switching tools."

### Closing (5 min):
**If interested:**
"Here's what next looks like:
- Week 1: discovery + implementation plan
- Week 2: install 1-2 high-impact workflows
- Week 3: rollout, training, and handoff
- Initial investment: $2,500-$7,500 depending on scope
- Ongoing support option: $1,500-$4,000/month

Sound good? Let's schedule a kickoff call."

**If hesitant:**
"Would a free proof-of-concept help? I'll build one tool for free, you test it. If your team loves it, we continue. If not, no charge. Fair?"

## PRICING STRATEGY

### Anchor High:
"Most teams spend $10k-$20k to stand this up with internal time + contractors. I can implement your first phase for $7,500 and have it running in weeks."

### Service Packaging (recommended)

- **Starter Install:** $2,500-$3,500 (1 workflow, 1-2 weeks)
- **Core Install:** $5,000-$9,000 (2-4 workflows, 2-3 weeks)
- **Retainer:** $1,500-$4,000/month (monitoring, fixes, new automations, team support)

### Value-Based Pricing Formula:
**Client's cost = (Hours saved per week × Team size × Avg hourly rate × 52 weeks) / 10**

Example:
- Save 10 hrs/week
- 5 person team
- $75/hr avg rate
- = $195k/year saved
- Your price: $19.5k

(Then transition to a retainer so revenue is recurring, not one-time.)

### Payment Terms:
- Installs: 50% upfront, 50% on go-live
- Retainers: monthly auto-pay in advance
- Minimum retainer term: 3 months

## OBJECTION HANDLING

**"We already use Zapier/Make"**
→ "Those are great for simple automations. This is different—it's conversational AI that understands context. Your team asks in natural language, no workflows to build."

**"Can't we just use Claude API directly?"**
→ "Absolutely, if you have engineering resources. I'm offering turnkey solutions—you focus on your business, I handle the technical complexity."

**"This is too expensive"**
→ "I get it. Let me ask: what's the cost of your team spending 10+ hours/week on manual tasks? This pays for itself in month 1."

**"We need to see it working first"**
→ "Perfect. Let's do a free proof-of-concept. I'll build one tool, you test it. If it doesn't deliver value, you owe me nothing."

**"We're not ready yet"**
→ "No problem. Can I send you a case study from a similar company? And let's reconnect in [30/60/90] days."

## SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK

- **Outreach sent:** 20-50 per week
- **Response rate target:** 10-20%
- **Call booking rate:** 30-50% of responses
- **Close rate:** 30-40% of calls
- **Average install size:** $3k-8k
- **Retainer attach rate target:** 50%+

**Math:**
- 40 emails/week
- 6 responses (15%)
- 3 calls booked (50%)
- 1 deal closed (33%)
- = 1 install at $5,000
- and 1 in 2 installs converts to $2,000/month retainer
- after 3 months, 6 installs and ~3 retainers = ~$11,000/month run-rate
